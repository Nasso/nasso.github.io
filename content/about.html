	<h2>&lt;/&gt; lover.</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>I've been coding and messing with computers since I was 10.</strong>
		Graphics/systems programming, web/game development, throughout the years I learned a lot of languages and technologies.
		And I still do today.

	<h2>self-educated.</h2>
	<p>
		You can't just rely on school and college to get new skills.
		<strong>I learn everything on my own</strong>, through experimentation, trial and error.
		I can easily pick-up a new technology or language really quickly.

	<h2>curious.</h2>
	<p>
		<strong>Software development is just my main hobby</strong>, but it's not my only one!
		Music production, UX/design, physics or hardware are all also part of my interests.
